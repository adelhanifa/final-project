                        <p>Assuming you have a list of personal goals written down somewhere,
                        much of your energy and focus will be on achieving these goals. One of the
                        most powerful ways I have come across to achieve personal goals is the practice of sharing
                        them with other people you trust.
                        The reason sharing goals with others is so effective is because when you share your goals
                        2 things happen:
                        <br /><b className="text-danger">1.</b> You Become Accountable for a groub of people with the same goals.<br />
                            <b className="text-danger">2.</b> You May Receive Help to achive your life goal</p>
